This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# uploading dataset and packages
  link="https://github.com/Data-Dumps/deliverable2/raw/main/dinodata_cleaned.xlsx"

  #call library
  library(rio) #note: Jose wants us to omit the install.packages line
  
  dinodata=import(link)


# our bivariate plot will display diet vs. length
  # we'll get rid of entries with missing length values
  # got rid of 18 entries out of 300+
  
  
  
  
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
